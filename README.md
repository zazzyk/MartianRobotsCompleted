# C# Martian Robots Coding Challenge
## Introduction

This project is my solution to a coding challenge, where I focused on using C# to solve the problem in a clean and simple way. I made sure the code is easy to understand by adding clear documentation to the classes.

I chose to use extension methods because they help keep the class focused on its main responsibilities, in line with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). By moving logic outside the class, I kept it more maintainable. Extension methods also make the code reusable, which would help if the project were to scale in the future.

I’ve written unit tests to validate the given scenarios using the sample input and output.

If I had more time, I’d build a UI for the project using a front-end framework like Vue.js.

## Requirements

- C#
- xUnit for unit testing and FluentAssertions for asserting the logic.
